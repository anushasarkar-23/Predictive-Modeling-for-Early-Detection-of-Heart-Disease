## üìñ About The Project

This project focuses on the application of machine learning to a real-world healthcare problem: the early detection of heart disease. Using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, we developed a system to classify the stage of heart disease in patients based on various clinical attributes.

The primary goal was to evaluate and compare the performance of three different classification models‚Äî**Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**‚Äîto understand their effectiveness and limitations on this particular medical dataset. A key finding of this project was the significant impact of **class imbalance** on model performance.

## üìà Project Workflow

The project followed a standard machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion to final model evaluation, as shown below.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project was built using the following technologies and libraries:

* **Python 3.12**
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models and preprocessing.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:** As the development environment.

##  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and pip installed on your system.

* Python
    ```sh
    python --version
    ```
* pip
    ```sh
    pip --version
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    (First, create a `requirements.txt` file in your project with the libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

##  Usage

1.  Place the `heart.csv` dataset in the root directory of the project.
2.  Open the `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3.  Run the cells sequentially to see the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.

##  Results

We trained and evaluated three different models. The final accuracy comparison is shown below.

![Model Comparison](07_model_comparison.png)

While Logistic Regression achieved a slightly higher accuracy of **65%**, all models struggled to predict the minority classes (stages 1-4 of heart disease) due to a severe class imbalance in the dataset. Their performance was strong only for the majority class (Stage 0 - No Disease).

---

##  Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the workflow for building a heart disease prediction model. The key takeaway is that for medical diagnostic tasks, overall accuracy can be a misleading metric. The severe class imbalance in the dataset was the primary limiting factor, causing all models to be biased. Future work should focus on techniques like **SMOTE** to create a more balanced dataset for training.
